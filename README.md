<h1>NASSP Coursework Codes</h1>

<section>
	<p align="justify">This repository contains all the codes I have written for the coursework component of <a href="http://www.star.ac.za/">NASSP</a>. I am a bit reluctant to share my codes here. If lecturers do not change their assignments, future students will simply take advantage of this repository. There will be no learning/originality. I'll decide what to do later.</p>
